===================How to Demo ===================== 
There are two main html file (bugV.html and index) 
Step 1: connect Leap motion 
Step 2: setup 2 screens 
Step 3: open bugV.html in the first screen 
  This file shows the problem of even we have a good visualization technique but when we face with big data it does not give you any insight and also hard to navigate.  
Step 4: open index.html in the second screen 	
  This will allow you to navigate bugs and filtering by priority. You just simply move the cursor into the box on the top left and point out your fingers to select bugs by the priority.
